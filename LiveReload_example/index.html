    <h1>Hello, dear reviewer!</h1>
    <p>I realize that you're not a web developer, and your job is already hard enough. So we'll be very quick.</p>
    <p>0. Please double-click 'index.html' to open it in Safari. I guess you've already done that.</p>
    <p>1. Please open 'stylesheet.styl' with TextEdit. (Web developers usualy use more powerful text editors, but TextEdit will do fine here.)</p>
    <p>2. To really enjoy the experiment, please position your browser side by side with your text editor, so that you can see both.</p>
    <p class='sample'>3. This paragraph is red. But if you now switch to TextEdit, change 'red' to 'blue' there and save (Command-S), it will instantly become blue.</p>
    <p>Pretty cool, isn't it? Just imagine all the time web developers used to waste previously.</p>
    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
